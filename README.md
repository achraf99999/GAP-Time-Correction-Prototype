# GAP Time Correction Prototype

This repository contains the full implementation of a prototype algorithm for adjusting running pace (GAP â€“ Grade Adjusted Pace) based on terrain elevation and environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal is to develop a correction model for running times that accounts for elevation and weather to allow for fairer comparisons between race performances.
